History
This project began in-house 8/8/2014 by Brian Ginn, the new Systems Coordinator of Materials Production. Why? We needed a way to handle the data behind the printed directory mainly the index generation automatically. Until now, the index was done by hand. 

It was data provided by MIS that was imported into a FileMaker Pro 13 database and processed and even maintained there until 2015 when the core data was moved into an Etherpad text file. Yes, a plain text file is what drives our end-users to modify and update the directory instead of a formal database of any kind. 

That Etherpad list of about 2,300 administrative contacts has the core data such as name, phone, fax, location and department or school. Each line is compared to another database in FileMaker Pro on our server named DepartmentHeadings. The link creates the formal line listing of the physical location.
