The "directory":
Allows easy editing without password access via the intranet via Etherpad which is a text-only online editor that allows multiple users to type at the same time. This is where the immutable data is kept. It is about 2,300 people and 154 schools and 109 departments listing. It is all public information. 

Anyone within the JCPS network can edit, add or delete any entries freely. No public access is allowed for the Etherpad. 

Editing will come in after any changes and confirm them correcting things such as typos, or titles that are out of the norm.

The next step is to export that list as text-only. 

That list is processed in a PERL script which serves the following needs:
1) The printed administrative directory with coded index. Also a PDF. 
2) Intranet ( soon to be public ) administrative directory as an online search/list.
3) iOS JSON data for schools, departments and people.

#1 above is done via import of text-only into FileMaker and exported as Adobe Tagged Text Format. Coded by Brian Ginn.
#2 and #3 are done via import processing using a PERL 5 script at github/usermac/jcpsdirectory
